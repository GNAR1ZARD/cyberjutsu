   First, identify open ports (e.g., HTTP on port 80 and HTTPS on port 443).

   ```bash
   nmap -p 80,443 target-ip-address
   ```

   **Sample Output**:

   ```
   PORT    STATE SERVICE
   80/tcp  open  http
   443/tcp open  https
   ```

2. **Attack with Nikto**:

   Use Nikto to scan the discovered web services.

   ```bash
   nikto -h http://target-ip-address -p 80 -o nikto_http.html -Format htm
   nikto -h https://target-ip-address -p 443 -ssl -o nikto_https.html -Format htm
   ```

   **Explanation**:

   - **`-p 80` and `-p 443`**: Specifies the target ports based on Nmap findings.
   - **`-ssl`**: Forces SSL/TLS mode for HTTPS scanning.
   - **`-o` and `-Format`**: Outputs results in HTML format for easy review.

   - Open Metasploit Console:

     ```bash
     msfconsole
     ```

   - Use a relevant Metasploit module based on Nikto's findings. For example, if Nikto identifies a vulnerable CGI script:

     ```bash
     use exploit/unix/webapp/cgi_script_exec
     set RHOST target-website.com
     set RPORT 80
     run
     ```

**Benefits**:

- **Streamlined Exploitation**: Transition seamlessly from vulnerability discovery to exploitation within the same framework.
- **Automated Exploits**: Utilize Metasploit's extensive library of exploits to take advantage of identified vulnerabilities.

## Monitoring and Managing Scans

Effective monitoring and management of Nikto scans are crucial to ensure efficient operation, accurate results, and the ability to troubleshoot issues as they arise.

### Real-time Monitoring

While Nikto doesn't provide built-in real-time monitoring dashboards, you can utilize terminal multiplexers or logging tools to observe scan progress.

**Using `tee` for Real-time and File Logging**:

The `tee` command allows you to view Nikto's output in real-time while simultaneously saving it to a file.

**Example Command**:

```bash
nikto -h http://target-website.com | tee nikto_scan.log
```

**Explanation**:

- **`| tee nikto_scan.log`**: Pipes Nikto's output to `tee`, which displays it in the terminal and writes it to `nikto_scan.log`.

**Using `screen` or `tmux` for Session Management**:

Terminal multiplexers like `screen` or `tmux` allow you to manage multiple terminal sessions, making it easier to monitor long-running scans.

**Example with `tmux`**:

1. **Start a new `tmux` session**:

   ```bash
   tmux new -s nikto-session
   ```

2. **Run Nikto within the `tmux` session**:

   ```bash
   nikto -h http://target-website.com -o nikto_results.html -Format htm
   ```

3. **Detach from the session**:

   Press `Ctrl + B`, then `D`.

4. **Reattach to the session later**:

   ```bash
   tmux attach -t nikto-session
   ```

**Benefits**:

- **Session Persistence**: Allows scans to continue running even if the terminal is closed.
- **Concurrent Monitoring**: View and manage multiple scans simultaneously.

### Session Management

Managing multiple Nikto scans efficiently is essential, especially when dealing with numerous targets or extended scanning periods.

**Using Scripts for Automated Scanning**:

Creating shell scripts can automate the initiation and management of multiple Nikto scans.

**Example Script (`run_nikto_scans.sh`)**:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Define target list
targets=("http://target1.com" "https://target2.com" "http://192.168.1.101")

# Define output directory
output_dir="./nikto_results"

# Create output directory if it doesn't exist
mkdir -p $output_dir

# Loop through each target and run Nikto
for target in "${targets[@]}"
do
    echo "Starting Nikto scan on $target"
    nikto -h $target -o "$output_dir/$(echo $target | sed 's/http[s]*:\/\///g').html" -Format htm &
done

# Wait for all background scans to complete
wait

echo "All Nikto scans completed."
```

**Explanation**:

- **`targets`**: An array containing the list of target URLs.
- **`output_dir`**: Directory where scan results will be saved.
- **`for` loop**: Iterates through each target and runs Nikto in the background.
- **`wait`**: Waits for all background scans to complete before proceeding.

**Running the Script**:

```bash
chmod +x run_nikto_scans.sh
./run_nikto_scans.sh
```

**Benefits**:

- **Efficiency**: Automates the scanning process for multiple targets.
- **Organization**: Saves scan results systematically for easy access and review.
