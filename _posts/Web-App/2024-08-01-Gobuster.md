## Directory and File Brute Forcing

One of Gobuster's primary functionalities is to brute-force directories and files on a web server. This process helps identify hidden or unlisted resources that could be potential entry points for further exploration.

### Wordlist Attack

A **wordlist attack** involves using a predefined list of potential directory and file names to probe the target web server. This method is effective in uncovering hidden paths that are not publicly linked.

**Example Command**:

```bash
gobuster dir -u http://target-website.com -w /path/to/wordlist.txt -t 50
```

**Explanation**:

- **`dir`**: Sets the mode to directory/file brute-forcing.
- **`-u http://target-website.com`**: Specifies the target URL.
- **`-w /path/to/wordlist.txt`**: Path to the wordlist containing potential directory and file names.
- **`-t 50`**: Utilizes 50 concurrent threads for faster scanning.

**Sample Output**:

```
/admin (Status: 301)
/images (Status: 200)
/login (Status: 200)
/uploads (Status: 403)
```

### Extension Bruteforcing

**Extension bruteforcing** allows Gobuster to append specific file extensions to each entry in the wordlist. This technique is useful for discovering files with particular extensions, such as `.php`, `.html`, or `.js`.

**Example Command**:

```bash
gobuster dir -u http://target-website.com -w /path/to/wordlist.txt -x php,html,js -t 50
```

**Explanation**:

- **`-x php,html,js`**: Appends the extensions `.php`, `.html`, and `.js` to each wordlist entry.

**Sample Output**:

```
/index.php (Status: 200)
/about.html (Status: 200)
/script.js (Status: 200)
```

---

## DNS Subdomain Bruteforcing

Beyond directories and files, Gobuster can be leveraged to discover DNS subdomains associated with a target domain. This capability is invaluable for expanding the attack surface during reconnaissance.

### DNS Wordlist Attack

A **DNS wordlist attack** involves using a list of potential subdomain names to query the DNS records of a target domain. This helps identify active subdomains that might host additional services or applications.

**Example Command**:

```bash
gobuster dns -d example.com -w /path/to/dns-wordlist.txt -t 50
```

**Explanation**:

- **`dns`**: Sets the mode to DNS subdomain brute-forcing.
- **`-d example.com`**: Specifies the target domain.
- **`-w /path/to/dns-wordlist.txt`**: Path to the DNS wordlist containing potential subdomain names.
- **`-t 50`**: Utilizes 50 concurrent threads for faster scanning.

**Sample Output**:

```
api.example.com (Resolved: 192.168.1.10)
/blog.example.com (Resolved: 192.168.1.11)
/shop.example.com (Resolved: 192.168.1.12)
```

### Virtual Host Bruteforcing

**Virtual host bruteforcing** You can use gobuster's vhost mode to brute-force subdomains over HTTP. This is particularly useful when you rely on /etc/hosts to resolve the base domain. The vhost mode tests virtual hosts by injecting subdomain names into the HTTP Host header.

**Example Command**:

```bash
gobuster vhost -u http://192.168.1.100 -w /path/to/vhost-wordlist.txt -t 50
```

**Explanation**:

- **`vhost`**: Sets the mode to virtual host brute-forcing.
- **`-u http://192.168.1.100`**: Specifies the target IP address.
- **`-w /path/to/vhost-wordlist.txt`**: Path to the wordlist containing potential virtual host names.
- **`-t 50`**: Utilizes 50 concurrent threads for faster scanning.

### **How It Works**

`gobuster` will append each word from the wordlist to the base domain and send HTTP requests using that subdomain in the `Host` header. If a server responds, it will identify the valid subdomain.

**Sample Output**:

```
admin.example.com (Status: 200)
/dev.example.com (Status: 301)
/test.example.com (Status: 404)
```

## Advanced Techniques

Gobuster offers several advanced features that enhance its effectiveness in various scenarios. These techniques allow for more nuanced and targeted scans, improving the quality of reconnaissance.

### Recursive Searches

**Recursive searches** enable Gobuster to perform subsequent scans within discovered directories. This deepens the enumeration process by exploring the directory structure beyond the initial findings.

**Example Command**:

```bash
gobuster dir -u http://target-website.com -w /path/to/wordlist.txt -t 50 -r
```

**Explanation**:

- **`-r`**: Enables recursive scanning, allowing Gobuster to delve into newly discovered directories.

**Sample Output**:

```
/admin (Status: 301)
/admin/login (Status: 200)
/admin/dashboard (Status: 200)
/images (Status: 200)
/images/icons (Status: 200)
/images/logo.png (Status: 200)
```

**Note**: Recursive searches can significantly increase scan time and resource usage. Use them judiciously, especially on large or complex websites.

### Handling HTTP Status Codes

Gobuster allows you to filter results based on HTTP status codes, helping you focus on relevant findings and ignore benign responses.

**Including Specific Status Codes**:

You can specify which HTTP status codes Gobuster should include in the results using the `-s` option.

**Example Command**:

```bash
gobuster dir -u http://target-website.com -w /path/to/wordlist.txt -t 50 -s "200,204,301,302,307,401,403"
```

**Explanation**:

- **`-s "200,204,301,302,307,401,403"`**: Instructs Gobuster to display only responses with the specified status codes.

**Excluding Specific Status Codes**:

Alternatively, you can exclude certain status codes using the `-b` option.

**Example Command**:

```bash
gobuster dir -u http://target-website.com -w /path/to/wordlist.txt -t 50 -b "404,500"
```

**Explanation**:

- **`-b "404,500"`**: Instructs Gobuster to omit responses with the specified status codes.

### Rate Limiting and Timeouts

Managing the rate of requests and handling timeouts is crucial to avoid overwhelming the target server and to ensure Gobuster operates smoothly.

**Setting Request Timeout**:

Use the `--timeout` option to define how long Gobuster should wait for a response before considering the request as failed.

**Example Command**:

```bash
gobuster dir -u http://target-website.com -w /path/to/wordlist.txt -t 50 --timeout 10
```

**Explanation**:

- **`--timeout 10`**: Sets the request timeout to 10 seconds.

**Adjusting Rate Limiting**:

While Gobuster doesn't have a direct rate-limiting option, you can control the scan speed by adjusting the number of threads with the `-t` option.

**Example Command**:

```bash
gobuster dir -u http://target-website.com -w /path/to/wordlist.txt -t 20
```

**Explanation**:

- **`-t 20`**: Reduces the number of concurrent threads to 20, effectively slowing down the scan.

**Best Practices**:

- **Respect Target's Resources**: Avoid setting the thread count too high, which can overwhelm the target server.
- **Use Timeouts Wisely**: Set appropriate timeout values to prevent prolonged waiting periods during slow responses.

## Combining Gobuster with Other Tools

Integrating Gobuster with other security tools can enhance your reconnaissance and penetration testing workflows, providing a more comprehensive assessment of the target environment.

### Nmap and Gobuster

**Nmap** is a powerful network scanning tool that can identify open ports and services on a target system. Combining Nmap with Gobuster allows for targeted enumeration based on the discovered services.

**Example Workflow**:

1. **Scan with Nmap**:

   First, identify open ports (e.g., HTTP on port 80 and HTTPS on port 443).

   ```bash
   nmap -p 80,443 target-ip-address
   ```

   **Sample Output**:

   ```
   PORT    STATE SERVICE
   80/tcp  open  http
   443/tcp open  https
   ```

2. **Attack with Gobuster**:

   Use Gobuster to enumerate directories on the discovered web services.

   ```bash
   gobuster dir -u http://target-ip-address -w /path/to/wordlist.txt -t 50
   gobuster dir -u https://target-ip-address -w /path/to/wordlist.txt -t 50 -k
   ```

   **Explanation**:

   - For HTTP (port 80), no additional options are needed.
   - For HTTPS (port 443), the `-k` option skips SSL certificate verification, which is useful if the target has self-signed certificates.

**Benefits**:

- **Targeted Scanning**: Focus enumeration efforts on active services, reducing unnecessary scan time.
- **Comprehensive Assessment**: Provides a fuller picture of the target's web infrastructure.

### Burp Suite and Gobuster

**Burp Suite** is an integrated platform for performing security testing of web applications. While Gobuster is used for enumerating directories and subdomains, Burp Suite can be employed to analyze and exploit the discovered endpoints.

**Example Workflow**:

1. **Discover Endpoints with Gobuster**:

   ```bash
   gobuster dir -u http://target-website.com -w /path/to/wordlist.txt -t 50 -o gobuster-results.txt
   ```

2. **Import Findings into Burp Suite**:

   - Open Burp Suite and navigate to the **Target** tab.
   - Use the **Import** feature to load `gobuster-results.txt`.
   - Analyze the discovered endpoints for vulnerabilities, such as SQL injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and more.

**Benefits**:

- **Enhanced Analysis**: Use Burp Suite's advanced features to perform detailed security assessments on enumerated endpoints.
- **Streamlined Workflow**: Seamlessly transition from enumeration to exploitation within the same framework.

Gobuster provides options to save scan results to files, facilitating later analysis and record-keeping.

**Output to a File**:

Use the `-o` option to direct Gobuster's output to a specified file.

**Example Command**:

```bash
gobuster dir -u http://target-website.com -w /path/to/wordlist.txt -t 50 -o gobuster-results.txt
```

**Explanation**:

- **`-o gobuster-results.txt`**: Saves the scan results to `gobuster-results.txt`.

**Appending Results**:

To append results to an existing file instead of overwriting it, use the `-a` option.

**Example Command**:

```bash
gobuster dir -u http://target-website.com -w /path/to/wordlist.txt -t 50 -o gobuster-results.txt -a
```

**Explanation**:

- **`-a`**: Appends the new scan results to `gobuster-results.txt` instead of overwriting.

### Real-time Monitoring

While Gobuster doesn't provide built-in real-time monitoring dashboards, you can utilize terminal multiplexers or logging tools to observe scan progress.

**Using `tee` for Real-time and File Logging**:

The `tee` command allows you to view Gobuster's output in real-time while simultaneously saving it to a file.

**Example Command**:

```bash
gobuster dir -u http://target-website.com -w /path/to/wordlist.txt -t 50 | tee gobuster-results.txt
```

**Explanation**:

- **`| tee gobuster-results.txt`**: Pipes Gobuster's output to `tee`, which displays it in the terminal and writes it to `gobuster-results.txt`.

**Using `screen` or `tmux` for Session Management**:

Terminal multiplexers like `screen` or `tmux` allow you to manage multiple terminal sessions, making it easier to monitor long-running scans.

**Example with `tmux`**:

1. **Start a new `tmux` session**:

   ```bash
   tmux new -s gobuster-session
   ```

2. **Run Gobuster within the `tmux` session**:

   ```bash
   gobuster dir -u http://target-website.com -w /path/to/wordlist.txt -t 50 -o gobuster-results.txt
   ```

3. **Detach from the session**:

   Press `Ctrl + B`, then `D`.

4. **Reattach to the session later**:

   ```bash
   tmux attach -t gobuster-session
   ```

**Benefits**:

- **Session Persistence**: Allows scans to continue running even if the terminal is closed.
- **Concurrent Monitoring**: View and manage multiple scans simultaneously.
