## Introduction to PowerShell

PowerShell is a powerful scripting language and command-line shell that is built on the .NET framework. It allows for direct execution of .NET functions and cmdlets, which are small, reusable commands designed to perform specific tasks. The output of these cmdlets is in object form, allowing for more sophisticated manipulation and interaction than traditional text-based output.

### Understanding the PowerShell Command Line

The PowerShell command line, accessible via the PowerShell console, is a robust environment for automating tasks, managing configurations, and executing scripts. This guide provides a comprehensive introduction to key commands and techniques to harness the full potential of PowerShell.

### The Power of PowerShell

PowerShellâ€™s flexibility, control, and automation capabilities make it an invaluable tool for system administrators, developers, and IT professionals. Its scripting capabilities allow for the automation of repetitive tasks and the management of large-scale environments with ease.

## Key PowerShell Commands and Their Usage

This section covers essential PowerShell commands, their functionalities, and examples to illustrate their usage.

### Navigating Directories

- **`Get-Location` (Print Working Directory)**:  
  Displays the current directory path.

  ```powershell
  Get-Location
  ```

- **`Get-ChildItem` (List)**:  
  Lists all files and directories in the current directory.

  ```powershell
  Get-ChildItem
  Get-ChildItem -Force  # Include hidden files
  ```

- **`Set-Location` (Change Directory)**:  
  Changes the current directory to a specified path.

  ```powershell
  Set-Location "C:\Path\To\Directory"  # Change to a specific directory
  Set-Location ..  # Go up one directory level
  Set-Location $HOME  # Go to the home directory
  ```

### File Management

#### Copying Files and Directories with `Copy-Item`

- **`Copy-Item` (Copy Files and Directories)**:  
  Copies files or directories from one location to another.

  ```powershell
  Copy-Item -Path "source.txt" -Destination "destination.txt"  # Copy one file to another location
  Copy-Item -Path "C:\SourceDirectory" -Destination "C:\DestinationDirectory" -Recurse  # Recursively copy entire directories
  Copy-Item -Path "*.txt" -Destination "C:\Backup"  # Copy all TXT files to a backup directory
  ```

#### Moving and Renaming Files with `Move-Item`

- **`Move-Item` (Move/Rename Files and Directories)**:  
  Moves or renames files and directories.

  ```powershell
  Move-Item -Path "oldname.txt" -Destination "newname.txt"  # Rename a file
  Move-Item -Path "file.txt" -Destination "C:\Path\To\Directory"  # Move a file to a different directory
  Move-Item -Path "*.txt" -Destination "Archive\"  # Move all TXT files to the 'Archive' directory
  ```

#### Removing Files and Directories with `Remove-Item`

- **`Remove-Item` (Remove Files or Directories)**:  
  Deletes files or directories.

  ```powershell
  Remove-Item -Path "file.txt"  # Remove a single file
  Remove-Item -Path "directory_name" -Recurse  # Recursively remove a directory and its contents
  Remove-Item -Path "*.txt" -Force  # Forcefully remove all TXT files without prompting
  ```

#### Creating Files with `New-Item`

- **`New-Item` (Create Files or Directories)**:  
  Creates a new file or directory.

  ```powershell
  New-Item -Path "newfile.txt" -ItemType File  # Create a new empty file
  New-Item -Path "C:\NewDirectory" -ItemType Directory  # Create a new directory
  ```

### Using Wildcards Effectively

Wildcards like `*` (asterisk) and `?` (question mark) can be used in PowerShell to specify groups of files or directories. These are particularly useful in file management commands:

- **`*` (Asterisk)**: Matches zero or more characters. For example, `*.txt` refers to all files with a `.txt` extension.
- **`?` (Question Mark)**: Matches exactly one character. For example, `file?.txt` could match `file1.txt`, `file2.txt`, etc., but not `file10.txt`.

### Viewing and Manipulating File Content

#### `Get-Content` (View File Content)

- **`Get-Content`**:  
  Retrieves the content of a file, displaying it line by line.

  ```powershell

## Running Commands as Administrator

When you need to execute commands with elevated privileges, use the `Start-Process` cmdlet with the `-Verb RunAs` parameter to run PowerShell as an administrator.

### Using `Start-Process` with `-Verb RunAs`

- **Start a new PowerShell session as an administrator**:

  ```powershell
  Start-Process powershell -Verb RunAs
  ```

## Utilizing PowerShell Commands Effectively

Maximizing efficiency with PowerShell involves mastering piping, redirection, and command chaining.

### Piping and Redirection

- **Piping**:  
  Passes the output of one command as input to another.

  ```powershell
  Get-Process | Sort-Object CPU -Descending | Select-Object -First 5
  ```

- **Redirection**:  
  Redirects output to a file.

  ```powershell
  Get-Process > "processes.txt"
  ```

### Command Chaining

- **Command chaining** with `;`, `&&`, and `||` allows for conditional execution of commands.

  ```powershell
  mkdir "NewFolder"; cd "NewFolder"; Get-ChildItem
  ```

## Using `Get-Help` for Command Documentation

Understanding PowerShell commands is facilitated by the `Get-Help` cmdlet, which provides detailed information about cmdlets, including syntax, parameters, and examples.

### The `Get-Help` Command

- **Basic Usage**:

  ```powershell
  Get-Help Get-Process
  ```

- **Example**:

  ```powershell
  Get-Help Get-Process -Examples
  ```

- **Updating Help Files**:

  ```powershell
  Update-Help
  ```

## PowerShell Package Management

PowerShell supports package management through cmdlets like `Install-Package`, which allows you to install software packages from various repositories.

### The `Install-Package` Command

- **Install a package**:

  ```powershell
  Install-Package -Name "PackageName"
  ```

## Advanced Object Manipulation

### Using the Pipeline for Object Manipulation

In PowerShell, the output of a cmdlet is an object that can be passed along the pipeline to other cmdlets for further manipulation.

#### `Get-Member` (Inspect Object Properties and Methods)

- **`Get-Member`**:  
  Displays the properties and methods of objects output by a cmdlet.

  ```powershell
  Get-Process | Get-Member
  ```

#### `Select-Object` (Create New Objects from Properties)

- **`Select-Object`**:  
  Selects specific properties of an object and creates a new object.

  ```powershell
  Get-Process | Select-Object -Property Name, CPU
  ```

- **Example**:  
  Select the first three processes based on CPU usage.

  ```powershell
  Get-Process | Sort-Object -Property CPU -Descending | Select-Object -First 3
  ```

### Filtering Objects with `Where-Object`

The `Where-Object` cmdlet filters objects based on specified property values.

- **Example**:  
  Find processes consuming more than 100 MB of memory.

  ```powershell
  Get-Process | Where-Object { $_.WorkingSet -gt 100MB }
  ```

## Scripting in PowerShell

### Basic Scripting Challenge

PowerShell scripts (.ps1 files) can be used to automate tasks. Below is an example script scenario:

**Scenario**: Check if specific ports are listening on the local machine.

```powershell
$system_ports = Get-NetTCPConnection -State Listen
$ports_to_check = Get-Content -Path "C:\ports.txt"

foreach ($port in $ports_to_check) {
    if ($port -in $system_ports.LocalPort) {
        Write-Output "$port is listening"
    }
}
```

### Intermediate Scripting

**Task**: Create a simple TCP port scanner for localhost.

```powershell
for ($i=130; $i -le 140; $i++) {
    $result = Test-NetConnection -ComputerName localhost -Port $i
    if ($result.TcpTestSucceeded) {
        Write-Output "Port $i is open"
    }
}
```
