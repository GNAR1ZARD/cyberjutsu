## Introduction to PowerShell Commands

PowerShell commands, or cmdlets, are essential tools for managing and automating tasks in a Windows environment. This guide introduces key PowerShell commands and their usage, offering a comprehensive understanding of how to work efficiently in PowerShell.

### Understanding the PowerShell Command Line

The PowerShell command line, accessed through the PowerShell console, enables users to interact directly with the operating system. It is a powerful environment for automating tasks, managing configurations, and executing complex scripts.

### The Power of PowerShell

PowerShell’s command line interface (CLI) allows for more flexibility and control compared to graphical interfaces. It supports automation through scripting, making it a powerful tool for system administrators and developers alike.

## Key PowerShell Commands and Their Usage

Let’s explore the essential PowerShell commands, their functionalities, and examples to illustrate their usage.

### Navigating Directories

- **`Get-Location` (Print Working Directory)**:  
  Displays the current directory path.

  ```powershell
  Get-Location
  ```

- **`Get-ChildItem` (List)**:  
  Lists all files and directories in the current directory.

  ```powershell
  Get-ChildItem
  Get-ChildItem -Force  # Include hidden files
  ```

- **`Set-Location` (Change Directory)**:  
  Changes the current directory to a specified path.

  ```powershell
  Set-Location C:\Path\To\Directory  # Change to a specific directory
  Set-Location ..  # Go up one directory level
  Set-Location $HOME  # Go to the home directory
  ```

### File Management

#### Copying Files and Directories with `Copy-Item`

- **`Copy-Item` (Copy Files and Directories)**:  
  Copies files or directories from one location to another.

  ```powershell
  Copy-Item -Path source.txt -Destination destination.txt  # Copy one file to another location
  Copy-Item -Path C:\SourceDirectory -Destination C:\DestinationDirectory -Recurse  # Recursively copy entire directories
  Copy-Item -Path *.txt -Destination C:\Backup  # Copy all TXT files to a backup directory
  ```

#### Moving and Renaming Files with `Move-Item`

- **`Move-Item` (Move/Rename Files and Directories)**:  
  Moves or renames files and directories.

  ```powershell
  Move-Item -Path oldname.txt -Destination newname.txt  # Rename a file
  Move-Item -Path file.txt -Destination C:\Path\To\Directory\  # Move a file to a different directory
  Move-Item -Path *.txt -Destination Archive\  # Move all TXT files to the 'Archive' directory
  ```

#### Removing Files and Directories with `Remove-Item`

- **`Remove-Item` (Remove Files or Directories)**:  
  Deletes files or directories.

  ```powershell
  Remove-Item -Path file.txt  # Remove a single file
  Remove-Item -Path directory_name -Recurse  # Recursively remove a directory and its contents
  Remove-Item -Path *.txt -Force  # Forcefully remove all TXT files without prompting
  ```

#### Creating Files with `New-Item`

- **`New-Item` (Create Files or Directories)**:  
  Creates a new file or directory.

  ```powershell
  New-Item -Path newfile.txt -ItemType File  # Create a new empty file
  New-Item -Path C:\NewDirectory -ItemType Directory  # Create a new directory
  ```

### Using Wildcards Effectively

Wildcards like `*` (asterisk) and `?` (question mark) can be used in PowerShell to specify groups of files or directories. These are particularly useful in file management commands:

- **`*` (Asterisk)**: Matches zero or more characters. For example, `*.txt` refers to all files with a `.txt` extension.
- **`?` (Question Mark)**: Matches exactly one character. For example, `file?.txt` could match `file1.txt`, `file2.txt`, etc., but not `file10.txt`.

### Viewing and Manipulating File Content

#### `Get-Content` (View File Content)

- **`Get-Content`**:  
  Retrieves the content of a file, displaying it line by line.

  ```powershell
  Get-Content -Path filename.txt
  ```

#### `Select-String` (Search within Files)

- **`Select-String`**:  
  Searches for text patterns within files, similar to `grep` in Linux.

  ```powershell
  Select-String -Pattern "search_term" -Path filename.txt
  ```

  - **Example**:
    - Search for the term "error" in `logfile.txt`:

      ```powershell
      Select-String -Pattern "error" -Path

 logfile.txt
      ```

#### `Out-File` and `Set-Content`

- **`Out-File`**:  
  Redirects output to a file.

  ```powershell
  Get-Process | Out-File -FilePath processes.txt
  ```

- **`Set-Content`**:  
  Writes or replaces the content of a file.

  ```powershell
  Set-Content -Path filename.txt -Value "New content"
  ```

### File Searching and Handling

#### `Get-ChildItem` (Search for Files and Directories)

- **`Get-ChildItem`**:  
  Lists all files and directories, with options for filtering.

  ```powershell
  Get-ChildItem -Path C:\ -Recurse -Filter *.txt  # Recursively find all TXT files
  ```

#### `Where-Object` (Filter Search Results)

- **`Where-Object`**:  
  Filters the output of other commands based on conditions.

  ```powershell
  Get-ChildItem -Recurse | Where-Object { $_.Length -gt 1MB }  # Find files larger than 1MB
  ```

### System Monitoring

#### `Get-Process` (List Processes)

- **`Get-Process`**:  
  Displays a list of currently running processes.

  ```powershell
  Get-Process
  ```

#### `Stop-Process` (Terminate Processes)

- **`Stop-Process`**:  
  Stops a process by name or process ID.

  ```powershell
  Stop-Process -Name notepad
  Stop-Process -Id 1234
  ```

#### `Get-Service` (List Services)

- **`Get-Service`**:  
  Lists all services on the system, displaying their status.

  ```powershell
  Get-Service
  ```

### Network Operations

#### `Test-Connection` (Ping)

- **`Test-Connection`**:  
  Tests the network connection to a remote server, similar to `ping`.

  ```powershell
  Test-Connection -ComputerName google.com
  ```

#### `Get-NetTCPConnection` (Network Statistics)

- **`Get-NetTCPConnection`**:  
  Displays network connections, including TCP connections.

  ```powershell
  Get-NetTCPConnection
  ```

#### `Invoke-WebRequest` (Download Files)

- **`Invoke-WebRequest`**:  
  Downloads files from the internet.

  ```powershell
  Invoke-WebRequest -Uri http://example.com/file.txt -OutFile file.txt
  ```

### Permissions and Ownership

#### `Get-Acl` and `Set-Acl` (Get and Set Permissions)

- **`Get-Acl`**:  
  Retrieves the access control list (ACL) of a file or directory.

  ```powershell
  Get-Acl -Path C:\file.txt
  ```

- **`Set-Acl`**:  
  Sets the ACL for a file or directory.

  ```powershell
  $acl = Get-Acl -Path C:\file.txt
  # Modify $acl as needed
  Set-Acl -Path C:\file.txt -AclObject $acl
  ```

#### `icacls` (Modify File Permissions)

- **`icacls`**:  
  Modifies file and directory permissions.

  ```powershell
  icacls C:\file.txt /grant User:(R,W)
  ```

### Archiving and Compression

## Running Commands as Administrator

When you need to execute commands with elevated privileges, use the `Start-Process` cmdlet with the `-Verb RunAs` parameter to run PowerShell as an administrator.

### Using `Start-Process` with `-Verb RunAs`

- **Start a new PowerShell session as an administrator**:

  ```powershell
  Start-Process powershell -Verb RunAs
  ```

## Utilizing PowerShell Commands Effectively

Maximizing efficiency with PowerShell involves mastering piping, redirection, and command chaining.

### Piping and Redirection

- **Piping**:  
  Passes the output of one command as input to another.

  ```powershell
  Get-Process | Sort-Object CPU -Descending | Select-Object -First 5
  ```

- **Redirection**:  
  Redirects output to a file.

  ```powershell
  Get-Process > processes.txt
  ```

### Command Chaining

- **Command chaining** with `;`, `&&`, and `||` allows for conditional execution of commands.

  ```powershell
  mkdir NewFolder; cd NewFolder; Get-ChildItem
  ```

## Using `Get-Help` for Command Documentation

Understanding PowerShell commands is facilitated by the `Get-Help` cmdlet, which provides detailed information about cmdlets, including syntax, parameters, and examples.

### The `Get-Help` Command

- **Basic Usage**:

  ```powershell
  Get-Help Get-Process
  ```

- **Example**:

  ```powershell
  Get-Help Get-Process -Examples
  ```

- **Updating Help Files**:

  ```powershell
  Update-Help
  ```

## PowerShell Package Management

PowerShell supports package management through cmdlets like `Install-Package`, which allows you to install software packages from various repositories.
