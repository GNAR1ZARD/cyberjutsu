## Basic FTP Overview

### FTP Protocol Basics

FTP (File Transfer Protocol) is one of the oldest protocols used to transfer files between a client and server. It operates in the application layer of the TCP/IP protocol stack.

- **Control Channel**: Uses TCP port 21 for commands and responses.
- **Data Channel**: Uses TCP port 20 for file transfers.

**Key Features**:

- Support for file uploads and downloads.
- Directory management commands.
- Clear-text protocol (no encryption unless explicitly configured with TLS/SSL).

---

### Active vs Passive FTP

- **Active Mode**:
  - The client connects to the server's port 21.
  - The server connects back to a port specified by the client.
  - Issues with firewalls blocking server-initiated connections.

- **Passive Mode**:
  - The client initiates both control and data connections.
  - The server specifies a port for the client to connect to.
  - Resolves firewall-related issues.

---

### FTP Status Codes

**Common Codes**:

- `220`: Service ready for a new user.
- `230`: User logged in successfully.
- `530`: Authentication required.
- `550`: Action not permitted.

---

## Enumeration Techniques

### Anonymous FTP Login

Some FTP servers allow anonymous logins for public access.

**Command**:

```bash
ftp TARGET_IP
```

**Example**:

```bash
Name: anonymous
Password: (leave blank or use your email)
```

**Output**:

```
230 Login successful.
```

---

### Directory and File Analysis

After logging into the FTP server, you can navigate the directories and retrieve files.

**Commands**:

- `ls`: Lists the contents of the current directory.
- `cd [directory]`: Changes to a specified directory.
- `get [file]`: Downloads a file from the server.

**Example**:

```bash
ftp> ls
ftp> cd Documents
ftp> get report.pdf
```

---

## Advanced Techniques

### Recursive Directory Listing

Some FTP servers support recursive directory listing, which provides a complete structure of the files available.

**Command**:

```bash
ls -R
```

**Output**:

```
/:
- file1.txt
/dir1:
- file2.txt
```

---

### Using Debugging Commands

Enable debugging for detailed information about FTP transactions.

**Commands**:

- `debug`: Toggles debugging mode.
- `trace`: Enables packet tracing.

**Example**:

```bash
ftp> debug
Debugging on (debug=1).
ftp> ls
```

---

## Exploitation Scenarios

### Uploading Exploit Files

Misconfigured FTP servers may allow users to upload files. This can lead to potential exploitation, such as uploading malicious scripts.

**Commands**:

1. Create a file locally:

    ```bash
    echo "Test content" > testfile.txt
    ```

2. Upload it to the server:

    ```bash
    put testfile.txt
    ```

---

### Exploiting Misconfigured Permissions

If files or directories have writable permissions, attackers can modify or delete content.

**Command**:

```bash
chmod 777 [file]
```

**Example**:

```bash
ftp> chmod 777 testfile.txt
```

---

## Combining Tools

### Using Nmap with FTP

Nmap's scripting engine can provide detailed information about FTP servers.

**Command**:

```bash
nmap -sV -p21 --script ftp-anon TARGET_IP
```

**Example Output**:

```
PORT   STATE SERVICE VERSION
21/tcp open  ftp     vsftpd 3.0.3
| ftp-anon: Anonymous FTP login allowed
|_Directory listing: /public
```

---

### Integrating FTP with Scripting

Automate FTP interactions with scripts.

**Example Script**:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
ftp -n TARGET_IP <<END_SCRIPT
quote USER anonymous
quote PASS
ls
quit
END_SCRIPT
```
