## Introduction to SMTP Enumeration

SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) is primarily used for email exchange, typically on **port 25**. Penetration testers exploit SMTP to conduct **user enumeration** by querying the server to verify if certain users exist. This enumeration helps in identifying potential email addresses or valid accounts for further attacks, such as phishing or brute-forcing.

## Understanding SMTP

SMTP includes commands for email exchange and server communication. Commands used for enumeration—**VRFY**, **EXPN**, and **RCPT TO**—allow different levels of interaction depending on server configuration and security settings.

### SMTP Command Overview

- **VRFY**: Checks if a specified username exists on the server.
- **EXPN**: Expands aliases or mailing lists to reveal individual addresses.
- **RCPT TO**: Used during email transmission to specify recipients, often used to verify users.

Some servers may disable these commands to prevent enumeration, especially those hardened against such techniques.

## Connecting to the Target with SMTP Open

After identifying systems with **port 25** open, connect to them using Netcat (or Telnet) to interact directly with the SMTP service and test for user enumeration.

### Connect to SMTP with Netcat

Use Netcat to establish a connection to the target SMTP server:

```bash
nc TARGET_IP 25
```

Replace `TARGET_IP` with the IP address of the server that has SMTP open. Once connected, the server may respond with an SMTP banner, indicating that it’s ready to receive commands.

## Enumerating SMTP Users

Once connected, you can use commands like `VRFY`, `EXPN`, and `RCPT TO` to enumerate users.

### 1. Using VRFY Command

The `VRFY` command checks if a user exists on the SMTP server.

#### Syntax and Example

```bash
VRFY <username>
```

#### Practical Usage

```bash
nc TARGET_IP 25
VRFY johndoe
```

**Expected Responses**:

- `250 OK - User johndoe exists` (valid user)
- `550 No such user here` (user does not exist)

> **Note**: VRFY may also return details like the full name or email address, but many servers disable this command to prevent enumeration.

### 2. Using EXPN Command

The `EXPN` command expands a mailing list to show individual addresses.

#### Syntax and Example

```bash
EXPN <group-alias>
```

#### Practical Usage

```bash
nc TARGET_IP 25
EXPN support_team
```

**Expected Responses**:

- `250 OK - List expanded` (with user list if valid)
- `550 Requested action not taken: mailbox unavailable` (alias does not exist or is protected)

### 3. Using RCPT TO Command

Typically used in email sending, the `RCPT TO` command can verify email addresses for enumeration.

#### Syntax and Example

```bash
RCPT TO:<user@domain>
```

#### Practical Usage

```bash
nc TARGET_IP 25
MAIL FROM:<tester@domain>
RCPT TO:<johndoe@domain>
```

**Expected Responses**:

- `250 OK - Recipient exists` (user exists)
- `550 No such user here` (user does not exist)

This command is often effective since many servers don’t explicitly block it.

## SMTP Enumeration Tools

Several tools automate SMTP enumeration:

- **Metasploit Framework**: Includes auxiliary modules for SMTP enumeration.
  
  ```bash
  use auxiliary/scanner/smtp/smtp_enum
  set RHOSTS target_ip
  set USER_FILE /path/to/userlist.txt
  run
  ```

- **Nmap NSE Scripts**: Nmap’s `smtp-enum-users` script enumerates users.

  ```bash
  nmap -p 25 --script smtp-enum-users --script-args smtp-enum-users.userdb=userlist.txt target_ip
  ```

- **Telnet**: Basic enumeration can also be done using Telnet.
  
- **Python Scripts**: Custom scripts allow flexibility and can be tailored for specific SMTP commands.

---

## Practical Examples

### Example 1: Enumerating Users with Metasploit

Using Metasploit’s `smtp_enum` module for SMTP enumeration:

```bash
use auxiliary/scanner/smtp/smtp_enum
set RHOSTS 192.168.1.10
set USER_FILE /path/to/usernames.txt
run
```

### Example 2: Nmap Enumeration Script

Using Nmap’s `smtp-enum-users` NSE script for user enumeration:

```bash
nmap -p 25 --script smtp-enum-users --script-args smtp-enum-users.userdb=userlist.txt 192.168.1.10
```

### Example 3: Connecting with Netcat for Basic Enumeration

1. Establish a connection to SMTP with Netcat:

   ```bash
   nc 192.168.1.10 25
   ```

2. Use `VRFY` and `EXPN` commands to verify users:

   ```bash
   VRFY admin
   EXPN sales_team
   ```

---

## Defense and Mitigation

To mitigate SMTP enumeration:

1. **Disable VRFY and EXPN**: Configure the SMTP server to disable these commands.
2. **Use Firewalls**: Restrict SMTP access to trusted IPs only.
3. **Logging and Monitoring**: Regularly monitor SMTP traffic for unusual activity.
4. **Rate Limiting**: Set limits to prevent brute-force or repeated enumeration attempts.
