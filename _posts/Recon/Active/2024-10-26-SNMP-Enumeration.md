## Introduction to SNMP Enumeration

The **Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)** is widely used to monitor and manage devices on a network. SNMP allows network administrators to collect data about network performance, detect faults, and control devices. However, if SNMP is configured with weak or default **community strings** or lacks security measures, it can be exploited to gain critical information about networked devices, including **IP addresses, OS versions, and network interfaces**.

## Understanding SNMP and Its Versions

SNMP operates across **UDP port 161** and has three primary versions:

1. **SNMPv1**: Basic version with limited security (community string-based authentication).
2. **SNMPv2c**: Improved version with bulk requests and minimal security improvements, still using community strings.
3. **SNMPv3**: Enhanced security with support for authentication and encryption.

Enumeration focuses on SNMPv1 and SNMPv2c due to their reliance on plaintext community strings, typically set as "public" or "private" by default.

### SNMP Concepts

- **Community Strings**: SNMP "passwords" used for authentication. Common values include `public` (read-only) and `private` (read-write).
- **MIB (Management Information Base)**: Database of SNMP objects that can be queried to retrieve specific data from devices.

## Enumerating SNMP with Community Strings

Enumeration via SNMP typically involves guessing or knowing community strings to access device information. Tools and commands can pull data if the community string is valid, allowing attackers to enumerate valuable network information.

### Common MIBs and OIDs

- **System Description (1.3.6.1.2.1.1.1.0)**: Retrieves a description of the system.
- **Hostname (1.3.6.1.2.1.1.5.0)**: Retrieves the hostname of the device.
- **Uptime (1.3.6.1.2.1.1.3.0)**: Shows how long the device has been operational.
- **Network Interfaces (1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1)**: Retrieves information on network interfaces.

## SNMP Enumeration Tools

Several tools aid in SNMP enumeration:

1. **Snmpwalk**: Traverses MIB trees to gather information from SNMP-enabled devices.
2. **Snmpcheck**: Checks for detailed information such as OS, hostname, and services.
3. **Nmap NSE Scripts**: Nmap includes SNMP enumeration scripts, like `snmp-brute` and `snmp-info`.
4. **Metasploit Framework**: Contains auxiliary modules for SNMP enumeration and brute-forcing.
5. **Onesixtyone**: Quickly brute-forces community strings to access SNMP devices.

## Common SNMP Commands

The following commands demonstrate how to query SNMP data using common tools:

| Command                       | Description                                   |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| `snmpwalk -v1 -c public IP`   | Retrieves information from target using `public` community string. |
| `snmpget -v1 -c public IP OID`| Retrieves specific OID data from target.      |
| `snmp-check IP -c public`     | Runs SNMP enumeration with `snmp-check`.      |
| `onesixtyone -c public IP`    | Brute-forces community strings.               |
| `nmap -sU -p 161 --script snmp-brute IP` | Nmap brute-forces community strings. |

## Practical Examples

### Example 1: Enumerating with Snmpwalk

`Snmpwalk` retrieves detailed SNMP information if the community string is correct.

```bash
snmpwalk -v2c -c public 192.168.1.10
```

This command queries all accessible information using the `public` community string. Substitute with `private` or another known community string if applicable.

#### Example OID Queries

To retrieve specific information, you can specify an OID with `snmpget`.

```bash
snmpget -v1 -c public 192.168.1.10 1.3.6.1.2.1.1.1.0
```

This retrieves the **System Description** for the target.

### Example 2: Using Snmpcheck

`Snmpcheck` provides a detailed scan output, often more granular than `snmpwalk`.

```bash
snmp-check 192.168.1.10 -c public
```

This command enumerates data, including the **OS**, **hostname**, and **network interfaces**.

### Example 3: Brute-Forcing Community Strings with Onesixtyone

`Onesixtyone` can brute-force SNMP community strings using a wordlist. To enumerate potential community strings:

```bash
onesixtyone -c /path/to/wordlist.txt 192.168.1.10
```

Replace `/path/to/wordlist.txt` with a file containing possible community strings, like "public" and "private."

### Example 4: Enumerating SNMP with Nmap

Using Nmap, you can combine UDP scanning with SNMP enumeration scripts.

```bash
nmap -sU -p 161 --script snmp-info 192.168.1.10
```

This command retrieves device information via the `snmp-info` NSE script. To brute-force community strings:

```bash
nmap -sU -p 161 --script snmp-brute 192.168.1.10
```

The above command attempts to brute-force community strings to gain access.

## Defense and Mitigation

1. **Disable SNMP if not needed**: Avoid using SNMP if there is no operational requirement for it.
2. **Use SNMPv3**: If SNMP is required, use SNMPv3 for encryption and strong authentication.
3. **Restrict SNMP Access**: Limit SNMP access to specific, trusted IP addresses.
4. **Change Default Community Strings**: Replace default community strings like "public" and "private" with strong, unique values.
5. **Monitoring and Logging**: Track SNMP traffic for unusual patterns, such as repeated failed login attempts.
