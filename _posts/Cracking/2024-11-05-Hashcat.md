## Introduction to Hash Cracking with Hashcat

Hashcat is a widely used, high-performance password-cracking tool that specializes in **GPU-based** cracking. Its support for GPU acceleration allows it to crack passwords significantly faster than many CPU-based tools. Alongside *John the Ripper*, Hashcat is favored for its flexibility and performance in both simple and complex password recovery tasks.

---

## How Hashcat Works: GPU vs CPU

Hashcat is primarily optimized for **GPU-based cracking**, leveraging the thousands of cores in modern GPUs to perform password cracking operations efficiently. While Hashcat also supports CPU-based cracking, a GPU is generally much faster for most algorithms. However, certain slower algorithms (like bcrypt) are often better suited to CPU-based cracking due to the design of the algorithm itself.

### GPU Requirements

Hashcat requires **OpenCL** or **CUDA** drivers to harness GPU power. Ensure that your system’s GPU drivers are up to date for optimal performance.

---

## Setting Up Hashcat

To install Hashcat on a Linux system, use:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install hashcat
```

To verify the installation, run:

```bash
hashcat -I
```

This command checks for OpenCL and CUDA drivers and lists supported devices.

---

## Basic Hashcat Syntax

Hashcat’s basic syntax is as follows:

```bash
hashcat -m [hash mode] -a [attack mode] -o [output file] [hash file] [wordlist/mask/rules]
```

- **`-m`**: Specifies the hash type (e.g., NTLM, MD5, SHA-1).
- **`-a`**: Sets the attack mode (e.g., dictionary, brute-force, mask).
- **`-o`**: Defines the output file for cracked passwords.
- **`[hash file]`**: Path to the file containing hashes.
- **`[wordlist/mask/rules]`**: Specifies the wordlist, mask, or rules for the attack.

---

## Hash Modes

Hashcat supports a wide array of hash types. The **hash mode** (`-m`) parameter tells Hashcat what type of hash to crack. Common examples include:

- **0**: MD5
- **1000**: NTLM (Windows)
- **1800**: SHA-512 (Unix)
- **22000**: WPA/WPA2 (Handshakes)

To list all supported hash modes, use:

```bash
hashcat --help | grep Hashmodes
```

---

## Common Attack Modes

Hashcat offers several **attack modes** for password cracking. The most common ones include:

### 1. Dictionary Attack

A **dictionary attack** (mode `-a 0`) uses a predefined wordlist as input. This is ideal for passwords derived from common words or phrases.

```bash
hashcat -m 1000 -a 0 hashes.txt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
```

### 2. Brute-Force Attack

A **brute-force attack** (mode `-a 3`) attempts every possible combination within specified character sets. This can be time-consuming but is effective for short passwords.

```bash
hashcat -m 1000 -a 3 hashes.txt ?a?a?a?a?a?a
```

### 3. Mask Attack

The **mask attack** (also mode `-a 3`) allows for targeted brute-force based on known patterns, such as “passwords that end with a number.”

```bash
hashcat -m 1000 -a 3 hashes.txt ?u?l?l?l?l?d?d
```

### 4. Rule-Based Attack

A **rule-based attack** (mode `-a 0` with `-r`) applies transformation rules to each word in the dictionary, increasing the likelihood of cracking complex passwords based on common patterns.

```bash
hashcat -m 1000 -a 0 -r rules/best64.rule hashes.txt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
```

## Cracking Windows Hashes with Hashcat

Hashcat can crack Windows NTLM hashes (mode `-m 1000`) dumped from the Security Account Manager (SAM) file on a Windows system.

1. **Obtain NTLM Hashes**: Extract NTLM hashes from the SAM file using tools like Mimikatz or SAMdump2.

2. **Crack NTLM Hashes**:

   ```bash
   hashcat -m 1000 -a 0 -o cracked.txt ntlm_hashes.txt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
   ```

---

## Advanced Techniques

### 1. Combinator Attack

A **combinator attack** (mode `-a 1`) merges two wordlists to try combinations of words.

```bash
hashcat -m 1000 -a 1 hashes.txt wordlist1.txt wordlist2.txt
```

### 2. Hybrid Attacks

Hybrid attacks combine dictionary attacks with mask attacks. For example, a common dictionary word followed by two digits.

```bash
hashcat -m 1000 -a 6 hashes.txt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt ?d?d
```

### 3. Using Rules for Custom Transformations

Rules allow custom modifications to dictionary words, such as adding a digit or changing capitalization.

```bash
hashcat -m 1000 -a 0 -r rules/custom.rule hashes.txt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
```

---

## Real-World Examples

### Cracking an MD5 Hash

Suppose you have an MD5 hash and want to crack it using a dictionary attack:

```bash
hashcat -m 0 -a 0 -o cracked_md5.txt md5_hashes.txt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
```

### Cracking WPA2 Wi-Fi Passwords

Hashcat can crack WPA2 handshakes using a captured `.hccapx` file.

1. **Capture Handshake**: Use a tool like Aircrack-ng to capture the WPA handshake and convert it to `.hccapx` format.
2. **Run Hashcat**:

   ```bash
   hashcat -m 22000 -a 0 -o cracked_wifi.txt wifi_handshake.hccapx /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
   ```

---

## Performance Tuning

Optimizing Hashcat’s performance can significantly speed up cracking. Here are some key settings:

- **Optimize Kernel**: Use `-O` to enable optimized kernels, which can increase speed but may reduce supported password length.
- **Workload Profiles**: Use `-w` to adjust workload, with values from `1` (low) to `4` (high).
- **Limit GPU Temperature**: To avoid overheating, use `--gpu-temp-abort` to set a max temperature.

```bash
hashcat -m 1000 -a 0 -w 3 --gpu-temp-abort=85 hashes.txt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
```

---

## Hashcat Tips and Tricks

1. **Identifying Hashes**: Use `hashid` to identify hash formats.
2. **Session Management**: Use `--session` to name and save your sessions, enabling you to resume later.

   ```bash
   hashcat -m 1000 -a 0 --session=ntlm_session hashes.txt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
   ```

3. **Masking Patterns**:
   - `?l` for lowercase, `?u` for uppercase, `?d` for digits, `?s` for special characters, and `?a` for all.

4. **Pause and Resume**:
   - Use `q` to pause and `r` to resume a cracking session in Hashcat’s interactive mode.

5. **Excessive Padding in Mask Attacks**:
   - In mask attacks, padding with additional characters (like `?a?a?a?a?a?a?a?a?a`) can reach deeper search spaces quickly.
